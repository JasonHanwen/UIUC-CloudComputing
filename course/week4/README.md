Cloud computing for the global services like Google and Microsoft.
They need to send data from data centres across the continent.

1 ingress and engress routers for MLPS 
inefficient use of the band available, because the difference of traffic in peak time and the original time
2 because most traffic in the traffic is background traffic which is not latency-sensitive traffic, so we do not mind about the latency for this traffic

Solution for the porblem
you need to distinguish the latency query like the request from the users. and the un latency sensitive query, like some background traffic from different data centers.
You have some back programs you want to do in the time scale of hours.

Build global server and collect the traffic information from local information

also build software switches.
